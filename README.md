# EatABurger

## An app inspired by SpongeBob and utilizing Express, Handlebars, and mySQL that allows the user to select a burger to be made which can then be interacted with.  

###### By starting up the page, you'll see three sections (cards).  Each card is a container for different actions that you can perform.

## Order up, Squidward!
###### The center card is where you simply give your burger a name (you can think of this as a person's name for their order, or the name of a hamburger itself).  Whichever way you think of it, just type in some text and hit the order button. 

## Burgers of the Future
###### This card is where each new burger name will show up.  So you order a burger called "Cheeseburger" and "Cheeseburger" will appear in this card.  Next to the burger/order name, there will be two buttons, clicking one will allow you to "eat" your hamburger and move it over the Burgers of the Past Card, while clicking the other will permanently delete that selection from the page.  

## Burgers of the Past
###### The third and final card is where already eaten burgers show up.  While in this card, you can permanently delete your chosen burger from the page.  You can aso choose to re-order that burger and it will show back up in the Burgers of the Future Card, where you can eat it again.  It tastes even better the second time!
